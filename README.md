    <p> Once upon a time, there lived two mice: Cheddar and his friend, Jack. Together, they dreamed of stealing the biggest wheel of cheese they had ever seen, left temptingly on the kitchen counter.</p>

    <p>One night, they decided to make their move on the cheese. Cheddar and Jack stealthily climbed up onto the counter, their blood coursing with adrenaline. But just as they reached the cheese, disaster struck! Jack accidentally slipped and got his tail stuck in the mouse trap.</p>

    <p> Cheddar became indecisive as he heard Jack's muffled cries for help. He had to do something quick otherwise both of them would get caught by the owner or the cat. Cheddar devised a clever plan to use a stick to pry the trap open and use a rope to escape. With a a little teamwork, they managed to carry the wheel up the rope just in time, before they could get caught!</p>
